# random-tools
Here are some random tools I created for personal use, I thought it might be useful for others too!

## type-deleter.py
A simple Python script that asks you for a directory and file type that you want to delete then proceeds to delete all matching files in all subdirectories.
```bash
python3 <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hrostami/random-tools/main/type_deleter.py)
```

Here are some random tools I created for personal use, I thought it might be useful for others too!

## type-mover.py
A simple Python script that asks you for a directory and file type that you want to delete then proceeds to move all matching files in all subdirectories to the folder type_files. It can also reverse the process.
```bash

```
